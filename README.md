# Small Business Analysis

As a group, we used two large databases containing information on small businesses in the United States, and we focused particularly the nuances and relationships that exist between the characteristics of a business and its owner with the successeses or hardships for each business. 

See our group's Final Report file for information about our research and data analysis.
